APPLICATION
Allow the user to enter one or multiple keywords. The application should retrieve the top 50 items listed on eBay.com.au and display relevant information relating to these products in tabular format and also provide the option to download these as a CSV.

The application should also provide a summary of the following metrics based on the 50 items list:
- Average character length of the title [X]
- % of listings with free shipping [X]
- Product pricing: average, min and max [X]

Feel to add additional functionality which you believe may be of relevance for a business such as MerchantSpring.
